# automatic-cooking-system
COMPONENTS USED - Waterproof temperature sensor , servo motor , jumper and normal wires , buzzer , lcd , keypad
ABOUT THE PROJECT - This project aims to solve the problems of old people generally farmers and others in rural areas.
                    They have the necssary ingredients but their age is a limit due to which they cannot cook their food properly.
                    It also aims to ease the busy schedule lifestyle of people.
                    This product is not full fledged developed but I develped a working model of the same.
WORKING - The user have to choose from the lcd that what food i to be made from a  list of choices.
           The user have to then put ingredients in the cups mounted on a wooden framework.
           The gas/chulha is place in the middle of the wooden framework.
           The temperature sensor keeps on checking the temperature and once optimum temperature is reached for that food
           (like you are making tea so at temperature like 80 degrees you have to put sugar, so) the servo motor will 
            rotate and the ingredeints are put in the cooking utensil placed on gas/chulha.After a estimated amount of time 
            i.e. when the food is cooked the buzzer will ping the user and the whole system switches off by itself.
IMPROVEMENTS - This sytem can be reduced in size using more proper components and framework, and machine learning can also be implemented
               to know what ingredients are to be put at what temperatures almost for any quantity of food. Use of robotic arms can                      facilitate working of the system without more of human intervention.
